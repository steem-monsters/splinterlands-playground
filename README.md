# splinterlands-playground

The playground for programmatic interaction with the Splinterlands platform.

## Features

The features of the Playground:
* Interactive tool for executing custom blockchain operations
* Examples of blockchain operations with lots of sugary delicious documentation

## Purpose & Design Approach

The Playground was built and designed to accomplish the following goals:
* Simplistic web design
* Lots of examples
* Integrated documentation and validation

## Local Development

To work on the playground locally everything was made to be as simple as possible with the least amount of work to get the project up and running. For that purpose, the files are served via a simple file system http server using the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm package.

### Install Local Http Server

To install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) its as simple as:

```bash
npm install http-server -g
```

See project documenation for more details.

### Start Local Http Server

Start the local http server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Access the site on a local port at http://localhost:8080
